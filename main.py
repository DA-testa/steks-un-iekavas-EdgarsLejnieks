"""
First priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesn‚Äôt 
have an opening bracket before it, like ] in ](), 
or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}

If there are no such mistakes, then it should 
find the first unmatched opening bracket without the 
corresponding closing bracket after it, like ( in {}([].

all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of matching brackets, 
such that in each pair the opening bracket goes before the closing bracket, 
and for any two pairs of brackets either one of them is nested inside 
another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in f(a,b)-g[c]. 
The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to }, and ( corresponds to ).

Input contains one string ùëÜ which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, 
punctuation marks and brackets from the set []{}(). 
 
Constraints: The length of ùëÜ is at least 1 and at most 105. 
Output Format: If the code in ùëÜ uses brackets correctly, output ‚ÄúSuccess" (without the quotes). 
Otherwise, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket,
if there are no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
